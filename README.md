## 🤔 Assumptions & Decisions Made

### Technical Decisions
- **React over Next.js**: Chose React for this assignment as it provides the necessary functionality without the complexity of SSR/SSG
- **Vite as build tool**: Selected for its speed and modern development experience
- **TypeScript**: Used for better code quality and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Chosen for rapid development and consistent design system

### Design Decisions
- **Component structure**: Modular approach with separate components for MainSection and Slider
- **State management**: Used React hooks for local state (dark mode, mobile detection)
- **Routing**: Implemented client-side routing with react-router-dom
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Theme implementation**: CSS-based theme switching with Tailwind classes

### Asset Management
- **Local assets**: All images and icons stored in `src/assets/`
- **Optimized imports**: Direct imports for better tree-shaking
- **Background images**: Used CSS background-image for card styling
